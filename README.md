## Model Providers

This template ships with [xAI](https://x.ai) `grok-2-1212` as the default chat model. However, with the [AI SDK](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs), you can switch LLM providers to [OpenAI](https://openai.com), [Anthropic](https://anthropic.com), [Cohere](https://cohere.com/), and [many more](https://sdk.vercel.ai/providers/ai-sdk-providers) with just a few lines of code.

## Deploy Your Own

You can deploy your own version of the Next.js AI Chatbot to Vercel with one click:

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fvercel%2Fai-chatbot&env=AUTH_SECRET&envDescription=Learn+more+about+how+to+get+the+API+Keys+for+the+application&envLink=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fvercel%2Fai-chatbot%2Fblob%2Fmain%2F.env.example&demo-title=AI+Chatbot&demo-description=An+Open-Source+AI+Chatbot+Template+Built+With+Next.js+and+the+AI+SDK+by+Vercel.&demo-url=https%3A%2F%2Fchat.vercel.ai&products=%5B%7B%22type%22%3A%22integration%22%2C%22protocol%22%3A%22ai%22%2C%22productSlug%22%3A%22grok%22%2C%22integrationSlug%22%3A%22xai%22%7D%2C%7B%22type%22%3A%22integration%22%2C%22protocol%22%3A%22storage%22%2C%22productSlug%22%3A%22neon%22%2C%22integrationSlug%22%3A%22neon%22%7D%2C%7B%22type%22%3A%22integration%22%2C%22protocol%22%3A%22storage%22%2C%22productSlug%22%3A%22upstash-kv%22%2C%22integrationSlug%22%3A%22upstash%22%7D%2C%7B%22type%22%3A%22blob%22%7D%5D)

## Running locally

You will need to use the environment variables [defined in `.env.example`](.env.example) to run Next.js AI Chatbot. It's recommended you use [Vercel Environment Variables](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/environment-variables) for this, but a `.env` file is all that is necessary.

> Note: You should not commit your `.env` file or it will expose secrets that will allow others to control access to your various AI and authentication provider accounts.

1. Install Vercel CLI: `npm i -g vercel`
2. Link local instance with Vercel and GitHub accounts (creates `.vercel` directory): `vercel link`
3. Download your environment variables: `vercel env pull`

## Prerequisites

- **Redis**: Required for resumable streams and chat functionality. Ensure you have a Redis instance running locally and set the `REDIS_URL` environment variable in your `.env` file.
- **Postgres**: For data persistence (see `.env.example`).

## API Usage

### Chat Endpoint

The main chat API expects a POST request with the following JSON body (see `app/(chat)/api/chat/schema.ts`):

```jsonc
{
  "id": "<uuid>",
  "message": {
    "id": "<uuid>",
    "createdAt": "<date>",
    "role": "user",
    "content": "<string>",
    "parts": [
      { "text": "<string>", "type": "text" }
    ],
    "experimental_attachments": [
      { "url": "<url>", "name": "<string>", "contentType": "image/png|image/jpg|image/jpeg" }
    ]
  },
  "selectedChatModel": "chat-model|chat-model-reasoning",
  "selectedVisibilityType": "public|private"
}
```

- `selectedChatModel` can be one of the supported models (see below).
- `selectedVisibilityType` controls chat privacy.

## Supported Models

The following models are available (see `lib/ai/models.ts` and `lib/ai/providers.ts`):

- `chat-model`: Primary model for all-purpose chat (default: OpenAI gpt-4o)
- `chat-model-reasoning`: Model with advanced reasoning (default: OpenAI gpt-4o)
- `title-model`: Used for generating chat titles (default: OpenAI gpt-4o)
- `artifact-model`: Used for document/artifact generation (default: OpenAI gpt-4o)

You can extend or swap providers in `lib/ai/providers.ts`.

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```
