# Product Requirements Document (PRD): AppStore for Agents

## 1. Overview

The AppStore for Agents feature will provide users with access to a curated list of MCP Servers that they can browse and install. This feature aims to streamline the process of adding MCP Servers to a user's configuration while ensuring they only use approved servers.

## 2. User Flow

1. User logs into the application
2. User navigates to the AppStore via the top navigation bar
3. User browses available MCP Servers in a card-based interface
4. User selects and installs desired MCP Servers
5. Selected servers are added to the user's configuration

## 3. Detailed Requirements

### 3.1 Navigation

- Add an "App Store" link to the top navigation bar
- The link should only be visible and accessible to logged-in users
- Clicking the link should navigate to the `/appstore` route

### 3.2 AppStore Interface

- The AppStore should present a visually appealing grid of MCP Server cards
- Each card should display:
  - Server name
  - Description
  - Icon/image
  - Install button
- Implement search functionality to filter servers
- Implement category filtering for different types of MCP Servers
- Include pagination if the number of servers exceeds the defined limit per page

### 3.3 Server Installation

- The "Install" button should trigger the server installation process
- Upon successful installation:
  - Update the user's config.json file with the new MCP Server
  - Display a success notification
  - Change the "Install" button to "Installed" or provide visual indication
- If the server is already installed, display "Installed" instead of "Install"
- Include error handling for failed installations

### 3.4 Data Management

- Store the curated list of MCP Servers in a database
- User-specific installations should be stored in the user's config.json file
- Implement proper isolation to ensure users can only access their own configurations

### 3.5 Admin Functionality

- Provide an admin interface for curating the list of available MCP Servers
- Allow admins to add, remove, or update servers in the AppStore

## 4. Technical Specifications

### 4.1 Frontend Components

- AppStoreNav: Component for the navigation link
- AppStoreGrid: Main component for displaying the grid of server cards
- ServerCard: Component for individual server information
- SearchFilter: Component for search and filtering functionality
- InstallButton: Component to handle the installation process

### 4.2 Backend APIs

- GET /api/appstore/servers: Retrieve the list of available MCP Servers
- POST /api/appstore/install: Install a selected server to user's config
- GET /api/appstore/user-servers: Get user's currently installed servers

### 4.3 Data Models

- MCP Server Object:
  ```json
  {
    "id": "string",
    "name": "string",
    "description": "string",
    "iconUrl": "string",
    "category": "string",
    "configData": { /* Server-specific configuration */ }
  }
  ```

- User Config Update:
  ```json
  {
    "userId": "string",
    "servers": [
      /* Array of installed server objects */
    ]
  }
  ```
